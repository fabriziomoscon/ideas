Goals

Make the world a better place

Idea
----

Providing a platform for open collaboration and discussion around civic issues affecting the society at small and large scale.

Concepts
--------

* Many issues could be resolved by an open discussion which will let many participate to the problem
* Some references (official or unofficial) could be given to point towards a solution
* Draft collaboratively a possible solution whenever the situation requires it
* Tracking down issues as a record of a particular happening or discontent
* Repository of questions and answers about popular issues

Detailed idea
-------------

Given the example of how open source software are build especially by the workflow the use of Github brought I could see analogy on how modern societies could benefit from collaborative software when looking for common issues solutions.
In particular a modern open source software is build by many people that version their written artifacts in a central repository and use an "issues" system to discuss and resolve problems encountered using the software itself.
When needed other issues of repository can be referenced within the discussion to provide more clarity around the issue, recognise it as duplicate or just to add more details to the problem at hand.
Any comment or contribution can be referenced back to the author in a specific point in time qualifying the author itself.
